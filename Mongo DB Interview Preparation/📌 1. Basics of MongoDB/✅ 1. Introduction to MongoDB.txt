1) What is MongoDB?

     MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (BSON format).
     
     It is document-oriented, meaning data is stored in collections of documents instead of tables with rows and columns.
     
     MongoDB is schema-less, allowing you to store data without a predefined structure.

     âœ… Key Features:

        Schema-less: No fixed structure; you can store different fields in different documents.
        Scalability: Supports horizontal scaling using sharding.
        High Availability: Uses replication for fault tolerance.
        Rich Query Language: Supports powerful queries with filtering, aggregation, and indexing.

2) NoSQL vs. SQL Databases

SQL Databases:

   Structured data stored in tables with rows and columns.
   Fixed schema (predefined structure).
   Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

NoSQL Databases:

   Unstructured or semi-structured data stored in collections of documents.
   Dynamic schema (flexible structure).
   Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

Key Differences:

   Scalability: NoSQL databases are highly scalable for large datasets.
   Flexibility: NoSQL databases allow for flexible schema design.
   Transactions: SQL databases support ACID transactions, while NoSQL databases like MongoDB support multi-document transactions (since v4.0).

3) Advantages & Use Cases of MongoDB

Advantages:

Flexibility: Schema-less design allows for easy changes to the data model.
Scalability: Horizontal scaling with sharding.
Performance: High performance for read/write operations due to indexing and in-memory storage.
Rich Query Language: Supports complex queries, aggregation, and indexing.
High Availability: Built-in replication and failover.
