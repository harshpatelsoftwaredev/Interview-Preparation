📌 4. MongoDB Interview Preparation
────────────────────────────────────

✅ Common MongoDB Interview Questions

     - Basic Questions (CRUD, Indexing, Schema Design)
     - Advanced Questions (Sharding, Replication, Transactions, Aggregation)
     - Scenario-Based Questions (How to optimize queries, How to handle big data, etc.)

✅ Hands-on Practice

     - Solve problems on LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks
     - Build a real-world project using Node.js + MongoDB
     - Design Database Schema for an E-commerce App, Blog System, or Social Media Platform

✅ Mock Interviews & System Design Discussions

     - Practice with friends or peers
     - Discuss system design challenges
     - Review past interview experiences from Glassdoor, LinkedIn, GitHub discussions

📌 5. MongoDB Project Ideas (For Resume & Interview Edge)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     1️⃣ E-commerce Database System (Products, Users, Orders, Transactions)
     2️⃣ Real-Time Chat Application (MongoDB + WebSockets)
     3️⃣ Task Management System (With Aggregation, Indexing, and Authentication)
     4️⃣ URL Shortener (TTL Indexing for Expired Links)
     5️⃣ Social Media App (Followers, Posts, Comments, Likes)

🔹 Final Tips to Crack MongoDB Interviews:

     ✔ Master Aggregation & Indexing – Most interview questions focus on optimizing queries.
     ✔ Learn Schema Design Best Practices – Know when to embed vs. reference data.
     ✔ Understand Transactions & Replication – For high-scale applications.
     ✔ Hands-on Practice – Theory alone won’t help; build projects and optimize queries.
     ✔ Be Confident in Answering Scenario-Based Questions – Think like a database architect.
